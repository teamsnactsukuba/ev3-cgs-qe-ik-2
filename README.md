## Contents

The contents of this repository are as follows:

- [src](./src/): Source code of the implementation
    - [data](./src/data/): data files of test data
    - [log](./src/log/): log files of the tests
    - [test](./src/test/): test scripts

## Prerequisites

For executing the implementation here, you need the following:

- OpenXM infrastructure for communicating mathematical software systems: http://www.openxm.org/
    - Risa/Asir, a computer algebra system: http://www.math.kobe-u.ac.jp/Asir/ (included in the OpenXM distribution and installed automatically with OpenXM under default settings)
- CGS: a program for computing comprehensive Groebner systems in a polynomial ring by Prof. Katsusuke Nabeshima: https://www.rs.tus.ac.jp/~nabeshima/softwares.html
- X Window System server (for executing OpenXM)

Path planning requires additional conditions:

- Wolfram Mathematica or Wolfram Engine (Version 13.1 has been tested):
- Running the above software on Linux.
