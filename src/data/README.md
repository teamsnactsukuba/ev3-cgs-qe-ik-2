# Data
This directory contains data files.

## Old coordinate data

Lists of coordinates of the end-effector used for tests in our current algorithm as well as our old algorithms.

These data were transformed from Python's data format. For conversion, please see 
[test scripts](../test#scripts-for-generating-test-sets).

*.rr is Risa/Asir program, *.dat is Risa/Asir binary file.
